# `taskman`
Simple terminal-based task manager

## Why?

I actually learned a little bit of C recently and I tried to put my knowledge to the test and I couldn't even write this simple task manager, so I deleted the whole directory and `cargo new --bin taskman`'d the project as a form of surrender.

## And?

I learned at least how hard and low-level C is, but also how Rust provides a simple codebase yet very similar performance, which is what makes Rust extremely real.
